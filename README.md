# Pomona Google Cloud Frontend Application (Google For Startups Cloud Hackathon Winner)


## Overview

Did you know, in Singapore, over 90% of our food is imported? Local production is important to reduce our reliance on food imports and one way to achieve that is vertical farming. However our local vertical farmers are sadly, challenged with high operational costs and cyclical risk. In the current landscape, local vertical farm start-ups face limited growth potential and poor platform economy, resulting in poor touchpoints with their end-consumers. \
<br>
Pomona is a gamified decentralized finance platform that promotes investments in local vertical farming produce.

## Features
### Marketplace
Aftering connecting their MetaMask wallet to our application, users can buy and sell vegetable Semi-Fungible Tokens of their choice on the OpenSea Marketplace integrated on our platform. 

### Dashboard
Users can track their current earnings from the digital vegetable tokens they have invested in so far. Users will also be able to view my current account balance on metamask, the date of the next harvest where they will be able to sell ther digital tokens as well as the total number of vegetable tokens I have invested in from the Pomona marketplace. 

## Technology Stack
Pomona's frontend application is built using ReactJS and deployed on Google App Engine. We also utilized Moralis Web3.0 API to index the blockchain, exposing API endpoints to obtain and store SFT-related transactions in our application, providing a verifiable audit trail on our platform for all executed contracts.
